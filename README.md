4. Dictionary for Variables Used


### Overview Objective Process Results
 - This secion gives the overview of the project, the process the team took to build the model, and the result

 ### Custom Machine Learning Model Builder
 - Allows the user to build their own classification model to predict the risk of a credit default

 ### Leaderboard of Previous Custom Models
 - Shows a ranking of different custom models that were ran and how "good" they were

### Sources Used
- https://ledatascifi.github.io/ledatascifi-2024/content/about/schedule.html
- Geeks for Geeks (multiple tabs)
- https://scikit-learn.org/ (also multiple tabs and mostly for documentation)
- Chat GPT

 ### Dictionary for Variables Used
 - Defines variables the model uses, the types of machine learning models a user can run, and the features for feature select and feature create
 The purpose for this tab is so that any user can run a model regardless of their machine learning knowledge
